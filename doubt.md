    CORS credentials: Enables cookie transmission between different domains

    Cookie parser: Reads and parses incoming cookie data

    process.exit(1): Critical failure handling - better to crash than run broken

    Refresh token security: Less data + server-side validation = more secure despite longer lifespan

Does this clarify the concepts? Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific part, like the actual token refresh flow implementation?
ok got it ,, now lets start out deep dive (learning and reading each line of code )  ,,,, but I wants to do that in the correct way , not just jumping to any random file and reading code !! , so please design a structured and sequential path which we should follow to master this project deeply and resolving doubts !! with check points ,,,( we will discuss the advanced concepts like or potential improvements after finishing our study ! so put that as our last check point ! ) !!

Excellent approach! Let's create a structured learning path that follows the actual request flow through your backend. This way you'll understand how everything connects.
